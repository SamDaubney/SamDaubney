- 👋 Hi, I’m @SamDaubney
- 👀 I’m interested in starting my Web Development career and moving on from IT Support/Networking
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CSS/Javascript for starters then moving on up to Full Stack!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! Always willing to expand my horizons and work on new projects.


- This Github account is that start of my new Journey where I intend to start adding to my projects on a regular basis.
- In this account, there will be a personal project page - DBY Digital which should be all about me and showing off skills.
- Alongside this main project, there will be two other live webpages that are being updated semi regularly.
- May also add in other projects as they come and go and we experiment more with GitHub and the learning process.
